# Thank You Action

Say thanks any time someone makes a new Pull Request on your repository!

* Add a new GitHub Action workflow:
```
name: Thank You

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  thanks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: colbyfayock/thank-you-action@master
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          TENOR_TOKEN: ${{secrets.TENOR_TOKEN}}
```
* You're welcome!
